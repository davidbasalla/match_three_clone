# Match Three Clone

This is an attempt at a Match Three style game in JavaScript. It's partly for learning JavaScript and partly to satisfy my long time desire to program a game.

Hosted on http://davidbasalla3d.com/match_three/index.html

## Specs

Uses the following libraries:
- lodash
- fabric
- webpack

## Development

Run `yarn install` and `yarn webpack-dev-server`. This will start up the webpack dev server on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and allows for hot reloading.
